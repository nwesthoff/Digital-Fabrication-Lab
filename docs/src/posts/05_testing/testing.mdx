# Scenarios

In the project we made to different parts, an app for the students and a webpage for the operator. Both parts need to be tested to make sure everything is clear and easy to use. Moreover we want to know if we missed functions or implemented functions are unnecessary. While testing and during the evaluation we want answers to the following questions:

- Is it clear how to place a request?
- Is it clear what the meaning of the icons is?
- Does the user understand how to navigate to several pages?
- What do users like and dislike?
- Does the operator understand how to accept the request?
- Is it clear to the operator how to change status and payment information?
- Does the operator think it is a good replacement for the excel sheet?
- What does the operator like and dislike?

After testing we will use the results to make the final concept, recommendations and add more information in the guide manual so TU Delft can implement the results. We want answers to the following questions

## Scenario 1

We ask a group of 5 (master)students to test our app, we start with giving some information about the project. Then we start a generator on our phone and give it to the student. We ask the student to execute several tasks, while the student speaks out loud what he thinks. With this scenario it takes a lot of effort to get results, but you can easily follow the thoughts of the student and see what he or she is doing. You can also quick add additional questions based on what the students says.

## Scenario 2

Another scenario to test the software is through a survey. We set up a google form, with a link to the generator. In the google form we will ask the students all the questions. With this scenario we can get a lot of results very quick but we canâ€™t see what students do, how long it takes student to get to the right page or if they hesitate.

## Scenario 3

In the last scenario we would go the the operators of the Digital Fabrication Lab and test the app and web page with them.
