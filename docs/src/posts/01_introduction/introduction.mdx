For the Digital Fabrication Lab at the TU Delft an app will be designed. Since students sometimes can have access to the printers, the projects need to be approved by an operator. The students need information on the printers, when to use which printer, costs and restrictions. Through the app they could request a project while providing information and the operator can approve the request.

The operator need a clear overview of the requests, whether it is already approved and/or paid. For the operator this overview is most likely a webpage replacing the excel documents used now.

## Requirements:

- Student can easily upload a project (with 1 or more files)
- Student gets notifications when print is ready
- Operator approves (or not) the project
- App shows the availability of the printers
- Showcase
  - View other projects
  - Set your own project to public
  - Like other projects
