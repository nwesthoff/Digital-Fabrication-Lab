Make an explorative study of existing solutions and select the most relevant ones that can help you to address your design problem. Make a summary of the functions of these solutions, and discuss how they can be used in your project. If software code is available generate UML class and sequence diagrams, in order to explore the structure of the solution and the operation of the software. Otherwise, make a simple block diagram of the software functions or a flow chart of the operations. Discuss why these solutions may be relevant for you.

## Technology exploration and analysis

Identify which technologies should be applied (GUI, Database, Sensor, etc.) in order to realize the functions explored in the previous section. Discuss what is your take away from this analysis.

- GUI
- Notifications
- Database
- Storage for models
- Algorithmic determination of print time?
- Authentication and routing (operators get extra functionality)
