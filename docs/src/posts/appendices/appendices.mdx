# Student 1: Thomas

## Tasks

**Upload order**

Filled in his information and logged in. Gets on the requests page, he clicks on the add button and than add a file, he forgot to click on upload file. He fills in the rest of the information and clicks on confirm.

**Go to the profile page**

Goes to the navigation bar and click on the profile icon. Tries to click on the switch buttons but they are not working yet.

**Upload a photo to the showcase**

“Looks like social media with the likes”. It is not that clear that it are all the public projects uploaded to the Digital Fabrication Lab. So he ask where you can follow people. After some explanation: “A cool”.

**Printer**

He switches to printer, “There are two printers available.” Clicks on the printer but nothing happens...

Q: _What did you expect when clicking on the printer?_

A: _More information about the printers._

## Questions

**What do you think about the navigation to the different pages?**

_It is very clear how you get to the pages you want to visit. It would be more logical to put the settings button in the profile page instead of the request page._

**What do you like about the app?**

_It is very functional and therefore very clear what you can do with the app. The floating button by request is very nice but might be a little bigger. The visual if you want to refresh the page is nice._

**What do you dislike about the app?**

_The app is graphical not that attractive, but since the app is for serious purpose it is not that disturbing._

# Student 4: Judith

## Tasks

Went to the right page directly and did press the upload file button after choosing a file.

**Go to the profile page**

Was pretty clear.

**Upload a photo to the showcase**

Weird that the uploaded photo didn’t show in the showcase app.

_It was quite clear, except for the fact the bottom navigation bar didn’t change when I was on another page._

_It was overall really clear._

# Student 5: Sjoerd

## Tasks

Thought that uploading the file was clear > you had to click ‘open’ when you only want to select it.

**Go to the profile page**

Was clear.

**Upload a photo to the showcase**

## Questions

**How do you think about the navigation to the different pages?**

_For me this was really clear_

**What do you like about the app?**

_That you can see the orders you already made on the request page._

**What do you dislike about the app?**

_The bottom navigation bar doesn’t change (yet) when you go to another page._

**Do you miss anything in the app, what?**

**What is still unclear?**

_How to make a profile._

**Are there any other comments?**

_Nice that the database works._

# Operator: Tessa

## Tasks

**Change status of request**

Tessa clicks on next, _“Oops, this already change the status”_ The word _next_ is not descriptive as a button for changing the status. Change _next_ in the next status like; _accepted_, _printing_, _printed_. Send mail button found immediately. The type category from the excel stands for Student Type.

**Set the payment information**

If students pay at the digital fabrication lab, they first need to pay before the request can be printed.

**Students need to choose a material and color by the order**

The back button in the order page is the back button from android itself, this is not very clear. Every type of printer needs some extra information from the student, therefore in the order page, fields need to be added after selection a type of printer.

## Questsions

**What did you like and dislike?**

_Everything is clear except for next/back button. In the app students have to choose a material. Missing more information and restrictions by the printers._

**How is the webpage in comparison with the excel sheet?**

_The whole project is mostly for students easier and more clear. It is easy to inform students and give them updates about their prints. Administrative, the excel is a few clicks extra but is not a large difference. An advantage is the online database, instead of the excel sheet on the computer._

**Order Numbers**

_Ascending numbers is easier, and the numbers have to start with a prefix, for example CX by a connex print. This is for their own administration easier._

**Do you still miss some information?**

_Mostly missing parts in the app like information on the printers and materials. In the webpage the wanted colors and materials by the student needs to be shown._

**What do you think about the app?**

_Different printers have different files, so a file error is needed by uploading the wrong type of file._
