As you may have seen the 3D print lab (Digital Fabrication Lab) is almost set up now and we get many requests of students to do print jobs. The primary function of the printers (Connex multi material printer, laser cutter, several Ultimakers and Blueprinter powder-printer) is research, but students sometimes can have access. An app could provide information on the printers, when to use which printer, costs, restrictions and so on. A student can make a request providing information on the job, relation with research, rendered image of object.
The printer operator gets request, approves (or not), student uploads project file(s)
Printer operator schedules/prints â†’ Student gets information when the print is ready
Ideally the information pages are on a website so they can be updated independent from the app, and read via the web (not only via the app)
The project files should be uploaded to a file server (or website), optionally the rendered image and short description can be uploaded to a hall of fame webpage
Make a short summary of the problem that you intend to address by a software solution running on an Android device. Formulate this problem as an design assignment and make sure that you end up with a short list of requirements(4-6 bullets).

For the 3D Print lab at the TU Delft an app will be designed. Since students sometimes can have access to the printers the projects need to be approved by an operator. The students need information on the printers, when to use which printer, costs and restrictions. Through the app they could request a project while providing information and the operator can approve the request.

Requirements:

- Student can easily upload a project (with 1 or more files)
- Student gets notifications when print is ready
- Operator approves (or not) the project
- App schedules the approved requests
- Showcase
- View other projects
- Set your own project to public + allow users to download files (if chosen)
