The admin panel is written in Typescript (optionally typed Javascript) and built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By using React, you are forced to create reusable components.

React Concepts
In React you write components that manage their own state. A React component (usually) contains the display and logic in a single place container. You are free to split up your application as you like, and pass data to child components using props.

A basic React (stateful) component looks like this:

```tsx
export default class Header extends Component {
  constructor {
    super(props);
    // creates initial state open = false
    this.state = { open: false };
  }

  handleClose = () => {
    // setState manages state in React, and rerenders
    this.setState({ open: !this.state.open });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        // clicking the button calls handleClose function to toggle open state
        <button onClick={this.handleClose}>
          // references an icon
          <MenuIcon />
        </button>
        // the drawer component knows what to render for each state
        <Drawer open={this.state.open}>
          // generic React child component
          <DrawerList />
        </Drawer>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

# Implementation of GUI

To match the look and feel of the Android app, we chose to use a Material UI Library to quickly build the GUI of the admin panel. We're using several reusable components from the material library, including:

```tsx
<Grid />
<Card />
<Table />
<Button />
<Switch />
```

# Implementation of technologies

The Admin panel depends on a few parts.
