import { Button, Grid, Switch } from "@material-ui/core";

The admin panel is written in Typescript (optionally typed Javascript 😍) and built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By using React, you are forced to create reusable components.

# Typescript Concepts

Typescript, like Java is an object oriented language, and like Java, it has to be compiled before being able to run (unlike Javascript).

# React Concepts

React Concepts
In React you write components that manage their own state. A React component (usually) contains the display and logic in a single place container. You are free to split up your application as you like, and pass data to child components using props.

A basic React (stateful) component looks like this:

```tsx
export default class Header extends Component {
  constructor {
    super(props);
    // creates initial state open = false
    this.state = { open: false };
  }

  handleClose = () => {
    // setState manages state in React, and rerenders
    this.setState({ open: !this.state.open });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        // clicking the button calls handleClose function to toggle open state
        <button onClick={this.handleClose}>
          // references an icon
          <MenuIcon />
        </button>
        // the drawer component knows what to render for each state
        <Drawer open={this.state.open}>
          // generic React child component
          <DrawerList />
        </Drawer>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

As the admin panel is quite simple, the project doesn't consist of many components. The App component holds the Header, Notification container and a router component.

```tsx
export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      // <MuiThemeProvider /> passes our custom theme to all child components
      <MuiThemeProvider theme={materialTheme}>
        <AppBar position="sticky">
          <Toolbar>
            <Grid container spacing={16} alignItems="center">
              <Grid item>
                <Avatar src={fabricationLabLogo} />
              </Grid>
              <Grid item>
                <Typography variant="h6" color="inherit">
                  Digital Fabrication Lab Admin
                </Typography>
              </Grid>
            </Grid>
          </Toolbar>
        </AppBar>
        <Router>
          // public routes require no authentication and will display the
          specific component without being logged in
          <PublicRoute path="/admin/login" component={Auth} />
          // Protected routes check whether the user is logged in first, before
          redirecting them to the passed component
          <ProtectedRoute
            default
            path="/admin/dashboard"
            component={Dashboard}
          />
        </Router>
        <Notifications />
      </MuiThemeProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

# Implementation of GUI

To match the look and feel of the Android app, we chose to use a Material UI Library to quickly build the GUI of the admin panel. We're using several reusable components from the material library, including:

```tsx
<Grid />
<Card />
<Table />
<Button />
<Switch />
```

A button and switch, for example. Looks like this:

<Grid container direction="row" alignItems="center">
  <Grid item>
    <Button color="primary" variant="contained">
      Button
    </Button>
  </Grid>
  <Grid item>
    <Switch color="primary" checked />
  </Grid>
</Grid>

# Implementation of technologies

The Admin panel depends on a few parts.

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Firestore/Auth
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) (global data store)
